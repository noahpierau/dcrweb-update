## Why Decred?

Decred was conceived by a team of Bitcoin developers working with legendary Monero developer tacotime.

Their vision was clear: empower coinholders through a unique hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining system that blends security, sustainability, decentralization, and user participation.
